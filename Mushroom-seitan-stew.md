Mushroom Seitan Stew
====================

>I want 'em real thick and juicy... and vegan. 

_Sir Mix-a-lot_

You might be able to skip the seitan if you don't have it, but it's pretty important to the texture. Black garlic is pretty food hipsterish, but it gives a nice, hearty, chocolatey ass-end and even shitty grocery stores are starting to carry it. Fennel is something Post-Punk Kitchen (who created the recipe that this is based on) puts in every god damned thing that is supposed to be beefy. It's not necessary, but it does add some depth to the flavor.

Mushrooms are key. They provide a lot of beefy texture. The PPK recipe is weak like old woman on mushrooms. I like a lot, like 8 to 12 oz, but I'd say 8 oz works. I prefer a mix of good quality mushrooms, like chanterelle, meitake, shitake, and oyster.

*Prep time, 30min. Feeds 4-6, or maybe just yourself*

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp oil
- 1/2 Large sweet onion, sliced thick
- 2 or 3 large cloves of garlic, finely minced
- _(optional)_ 2 cloves black garlic, finely minced
- 3 medium-to-large carrots, sliced thickly (like 1/2" on a bias looks nice)
- 2 large stalks of celery, sliced thickly (same as carrots)
- 2 or 3 medium-to-large po-ta-toes, peeled and cut into large chunks (you're not going to boil 'em, mash 'em, but put 'em in a stew)
- 8 oz mushroom, sliced
- 2 tbsp Earth Balance (or unsalted butter, if you don't want to get invited to the vegan pants party)
- 1 cup red wine
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1 tsp dried rosemary
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- _(optional)_ 1 or 2 dried bay leaves
- _(optional)_ 1/2 tsp ground fennel seed
- 3 cups vegetable broth (you can use a whole 32 oz container if you want, it just makes more grrrrravayyyyy)
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt (or Hawaiian Black is nice!)
- Pepper, fresh ground (a few small pinches, like 1/8 tsp)
- 1 package seitan, bite-sized cubes
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup water
- 2 tbsp tomato paste (or 1 tbsp double concentrated paste from tube mixed with 1 tbsp water)


## Directions

Heat a good sized dutch oven or pot to medium with the oil. Sautee the onions in the oil until soft and translucent with a small pinch of salt, maybe 5 minutes. Add the butter and the garlic, cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add mushrooms and black garlic with another small pinch of salt and pepper, cook until soft and buttery, about 5 to 8 minutes.

Add the wine, carrots, celery, thyme, rosemary, paprika, fennel, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil and reduce by about half, maybe 5 minutes. Add the broth and bring to a boil. Add potatoes and cook for 20 minutes.

In the meantime, brown the seitan and add within the last 5 minutes of the 20 minutes previously mentioned.

Whisk the flour and water so it is not lumpy. Slowly stir in the flour mixture very little bit at a time, making sure it is well mixed before adding more. Finally, add the tomato paste and stir. Let it thicken, about 5 minutes, then check salt and pepper.

## How to Enjoy

Toast some soft bread and scoop up stew with it. Open your face hole and stuff stew/bread mixture in until you don't feel feelings anymore.
